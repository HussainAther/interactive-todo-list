### Interactive Coding Assessment Instructions

---

#### **Objective**
You will be tasked with building a simple interactive web application—a To-Do List application—using Flask. This assessment is designed to evaluate your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of CI/CD concepts in a real-time setting.

#### **Project Requirements**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - You will receive a GitHub repository link. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     cd <repository-folder>
     ```

2. **Set Up the Application**:
   - Create a new Flask application that meets the following criteria:
     - **Add Task**: Allow users to add a task with a title.
     - **Display Tasks**: Show a list of current tasks.
     - **Remove Task**: Enable users to remove a task.
     - **Mark Task as Complete**: Allow users to mark tasks as complete, visually indicating completion (e.g., strikethrough).

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document your process in a README file explaining:
     - How to run the application.
     - Any assumptions made during the setup.
     - How you would set up a CI/CD pipeline for this application.

4. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Discuss how you would implement a CI/CD pipeline for the application using GitHub Actions or a similar tool. Be prepared to explain:
     - What tests you would run in the pipeline.
     - How the pipeline would be triggered (e.g., on push, pull request).

#### **Time Limit**
You will have **60 minutes** to complete this coding assessment.

#### **Environment Setup**
- Ensure you have Python and Flask installed. If not, you can install Flask using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install Flask
  ```

#### **Assessment Process**
- **Live Coding**: As you work on the application, please explain your thought process and the decisions you make. This will help us understand your approach and reasoning.
- **Ask Questions**: Feel free to ask questions during the assessment if you need clarification or guidance.

#### **Submission**
At the end of the assessment:
- Ensure your application is working correctly.
- Push your changes to the GitHub repository and provide the repository URL for review.

#### **Evaluation Criteria**
Your performance will be evaluated based on:
- Code quality and organization.
- Completeness and functionality of the application.
- Clarity of documentation.
- Ability to communicate your thought process and problem-solving approach.
